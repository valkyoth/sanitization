# Target Tiers

This document classifies target support for the high-assurance and native
`ct` features. The machine-readable form is `docs/ct-evidence.json`.

## Tier Definitions

| Tier | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| Tier A | CI-covered release evidence plus target-specific codegen or proof evidence for the listed feature set. |
| Tier B | Source-level discipline and tests, but no complete target-specific timing evidence. |
| Tier C | API compatibility only, with reduced or no strong data-oblivious timing claim. |
| Forbidden | Known-bad or intentionally rejected target/feature combination. |

Tier names are evidence labels, not security certifications.

## Current Target Position

The CP-20 workflow emits a dated manifest for every row. Compiler versions are
the repository toolchain selected by `rust-toolchain.toml`; the exact rustc and
runner image are recorded in each artifact rather than implied by this table.

| Target/profile | Tier | Runner/evidence class | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu` | A candidate | Native `ubuntu-24.04` | All-feature functional tests, path-specific release codegen scan, relative performance baseline, and portable/strict multi-seed leakage runs. |
| `aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu` | B native | Native `ubuntu-24.04-arm` | All-feature functional tests, AArch64 release codegen scan, relative performance baseline, and portable/strict multi-seed leakage runs. |
| `x86_64-pc-windows-msvc` | B native | Native `windows-2025` | Portable-native feature tests, x86_64 release codegen scan, and relative performance baseline; no timing claim. |
| `aarch64-apple-darwin` | B native | Native `macos-15` | Portable-native feature tests, AArch64 release codegen scan, relative performance baseline, and portable/strict multi-seed leakage runs. |
| `x86_64-unknown-freebsd` | B compile-only | Cross-compiled on Linux | Memory-lock, guard-page, and multi-pass feature compilation; no native syscall or timing claim. |
| `aarch64-linux-android` | B compile-only | Cross-compiled on Linux | Native-feature compilation only; no device runtime or timing claim. |
| `aarch64-apple-ios` | B compile-only | Cross-compiled on macOS | Native-feature compilation only; no device runtime or timing claim. |
| `thumbv7em-none-eabihf` | B/C compile-only | Cross-compiled on Linux | Core `no_std` compilation; no device-level leakage evidence. |
| `riscv32imac-unknown-none-elf` | B/C compile-only | Cross-compiled on Linux | Core `no_std` compilation; no device-level leakage evidence. |
| `wasm32-unknown-unknown`, `wasm32-wasip1`, `wasm32-wasip2` | C | Cross-compiled compatibility | API/build compatibility with documented volatile, JIT, memory-lock, and page-protection limits. |

## Feature Availability

| Feature area | Native Linux/Android | macOS/iOS/BSD | Windows | WASM |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Default volatile clearing | Yes | Yes | Yes | Best effort, reduced claim |
| `alloc` containers | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes with allocator |
| `memory-lock` | Yes | Yes where backend supports it | Yes | Only with `wasm-compat`, no host lock |
| `guard-pages` | Yes | Yes where backend supports it | Yes | No |
| `canary-check` | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes for compat backends where exposed |
| `random-canary` | OS CSPRNG | OS CSPRNG | OS CSPRNG | WASI where host random exists; unsupported otherwise |
| `asm-compare` | x86_64/AArch64 where implemented | x86_64/AArch64 where implemented | x86_64/AArch64 where ABI-safe | No strong JIT claim |
| `cache-flush` | Checked x86_64 eviction; other architectures return unsupported after wipe | Checked x86_64 eviction; other architectures return unsupported after wipe | Checked x86_64 eviction | Structured unsupported result |
| `register-scrub` | x86_64/AArch64 reported best effort | x86_64/AArch64 reported best effort | x86_64/AArch64 reported best effort | Structured unsupported result |

## Named Profile Availability

| Profile | Linux x86_64/AArch64 | macOS/iOS x86_64/AArch64 | Windows x86_64/AArch64 | Android x86_64/AArch64 | BSD x86_64/AArch64 | WASM |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `profile-hardened-native` | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes where the native backend compiles | Forbidden |
| `profile-guarded-native` | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes where guard pages compile | Forbidden |
| `profile-hardened-linux` | Yes | Forbidden | Forbidden | Forbidden | Forbidden | Forbidden |

Profiles describe compiled capability. The matching `ProtectionRequest`
describes required/preferred policy, and each runtime `ProtectionReport`
records achieved controls. See `docs/FEATURE_PROFILES.md`.

## Release-Candidate Requirements

A stable `2.0.0` candidate should attach or cite:

- exact rustc version;
- exact target triple;
- exact feature set;
- CI run URL or local command transcript;
- `docs/ct-evidence.json` validation result;
- release codegen check result;
- Kani result when available;
- Miri result when available;
- any known target-specific residual risks.

Use `scripts/evidence-report.py` to capture the local commit, rustc host,
installed targets, and optional Kani/Miri tool availability for this evidence.

Use the `CP-20 target evidence` workflow artifacts for target classification.
Do not describe a cross-compiled manifest as native evidence. Artifact
retention is temporary, so final release evidence must preserve the accepted
workflow run URLs and artifact digests in the 2.0 release record.

Targets without this evidence should remain Tier B or Tier C rather than being
promoted by assumption.
