# Guarantees

This document defines the security claims this repository is willing to make.
It should be read together with `docs/NON_GUARANTEES.md`, `docs/THREAT_MODEL.md`,
`docs/SAFETY.md`, `docs/BARRIERS.md`, `docs/TARGETS.md`,
`docs/REPRODUCIBLE_BUILDS.md`, and `docs/EVIDENCE.md`.

The short version: `sanitization` provides dependency-free secret ownership,
optimizer-resistant clearing, and data-oblivious primitives under documented
target and feature conditions. It does not claim identical wall-clock timing or
complete protection against every process, OS, hardware, compiler, or runtime
side channel.

## Secret Ownership

For crate-owned secret containers, the crate guarantees:

- secret-owning containers do not implement `Copy`;
- secret-owning containers do not expose raw secret references through `Debug`;
- container `Debug` output is redacted;
- ordinary equality for secret containers is avoided in favor of explicit
  comparison APIs;
- public exposure goes through narrow closure-based APIs where practical;
- drop-time clearing is installed for the crate-owned secret containers.

These guarantees apply to bytes owned by the crate. They do not revoke copies
that were already created by caller code, external libraries, deserializers,
formatters, syscalls, kernels, runtimes, debuggers, or hardware.

## Clearing

All default clearing paths bottom out in volatile byte writes through the
audited wipe boundary. This is the crate's primary clearing guarantee:

- clearing stores are emitted as volatile operations on native targets;
- compiler fences and hardware fences are used around the wipe boundary;
- heap containers wipe initialized bytes and spare capacity that the crate can
  reach before releasing the allocation;
- replacement helpers clear the old value before installing the new value where
  the API can do so safely;
- explicit volatile helper functions are available for ordinary byte buffers.
- `BoundedSecretVec<MAX>` checks its public maximum before construction,
  append, replacement, and every supported serde visitor input form.
- Ordinary `SecretVec` serde rejects inputs larger than the documented 1 MiB
  default ceiling rather than allocating without a crate-level bound.
- `BoundedSecretString<MAX>` checks its public UTF-8 byte maximum before
  construction, append, replacement, and supported serde string inputs.
- Ordinary `SecretString` serde rejects inputs larger than the documented
  1 MiB byte ceiling.
- Consuming `SecretVec`/`SecretString` conversions transfer the existing heap
  allocation after UTF-8 validation. Invalid byte input is cleared before the
  conversion error is returned.

The guarantee is about bytes reachable through the current allocation or
container. It does not cover allocator metadata, stale copies from earlier
Rust moves, prior stack frames, external buffers, or allocations already freed
before they entered a crate-owned type.

## Locked And Guarded Storage

When `memory-lock` is enabled on supported native targets, locked containers
attempt to keep their owned secret storage out of swap/pagefile paths using the
platform's memory-locking facility. On Linux-family targets, supported
constructors also request `MADV_DONTDUMP`, and when available they request
`MADV_DONTFORK` unless the platform-specific backend documents otherwise.

Cargo features describe compiled capability. Runtime success is represented by
`ProtectionReport`, retained by mapped byte and text containers. Explicit
`ProtectionRequest` values make each control required, preferred, or not
requested. A required failure returns a structured `ProtectionError` and no
container; a preferred failure can succeed only with a reduced state recorded
in the report.

The stronger native storage types guarantee:

- locked mappings are cleared before unlock/unmap on drop;
- `LockedSecretString` delegates its storage lifecycle to `LockedSecretVec`
  while restricting safe exposure to valid UTF-8;
- failed constructors do not intentionally leak successfully created mappings;
- canary-enabled mappings verify prefix/suffix integrity before exposure,
  mutation, replacement, copying, and comparison, clear corrupted storage, and
  return a structured error from ordinary APIs;
- guarded dynamic storage places inaccessible guard pages around the writable
  region on supported native targets.
- `GuardedSecretString` delegates its storage lifecycle to
  `GuardedSecretVec` while restricting safe exposure to valid UTF-8.
- protection reports contain only public operational metadata and never
  addresses, canary values, or secret-derived contents.

When `require-fork-exclusion` is enabled, native locked constructors fail
closed on platforms where fork-inheritance exclusion is unavailable.
Explicit Linux policies can alternatively allow inheritance or request
`MADV_WIPEONFORK`; the retained report records the requested policy and actual
outcome.

On WASM, `memory-lock` is available only with `wasm-compat` and is an
API-compatibility backend. It guarantees owned WASM storage and drop-time
clearing, not host OS memory locking.

## Data-Oblivious Primitives

The native `sanitization::ct` module is designed around this claim:

> No secret-dependent control flow or secret-dependent memory access inside
> the provided primitives, under the documented compiler, target, feature, and
> release-profile conditions.

The data-oblivious guarantees apply to the crate's own primitives:

- `ct::Choice` and masks normalize secret-derived boolean-like values;
- fixed-size equality and ordering scan every public element;
- public-length equality treats length as public metadata and rejects length
  mismatch without claiming the length is secret;
- `ct::CtOption` and `ct::CtResult` keep success/failure state inside the CT
  domain until explicit declassification for public or non-secret backing
  values;
- `ct::SecretIndex` and `ct::SecretScalar<T>` are non-copying, redacted,
  clear-on-drop owners with consuming reason-bearing declassification;
- `ct::SecretCtOption` and `ct::SecretCtResult` clear dummy and unselected
  `ct::SecretValue<T>` backing values before transferring a selected value;
- `ct::oblivious_lookup` scans the full public table length instead of indexing
  directly by a secret index;
- conditional copy, swap, and slice selection operate over public lengths.

Turning a secret-derived value into normal control flow must happen through an
explicit `declassify(reason)` boundary. The reason string is not a runtime
security mechanism; it exists to make public-branch decisions searchable and
reviewable.

## Consume-Once Ownership

`ConsumeOnceSecret<T>` permits exactly one successful scoped shared exposure:

- racing callers claim access with one atomic transition;
- the successful closure receives `&T`, not ownership or mutable access;
- later callers are rejected;
- the wrapped value is cleared after normal return, application-level error,
  or panic unwinding;
- a never-consumed value is cleared on drop; and
- shared exposure requires `T: StableSharedSecretStorage`.

This guarantee covers access through the wrapper. The winning closure can
deliberately copy or export data, and process abort, compiler-created
temporaries, Rust move history, and register residue remain outside it.

## Fixed Secure Arenas

`SecretPool<N, SLOTS>` provides a bounded fixed-size arena:

- one atomic bitmap claim prevents overlapping safe handles for a slot;
- every successful claim receives a new non-zero generation;
- lifetime-bound handles prevent pool drop or mutable pool clearing while live;
- slot drop clears before release;
- the next acquire observes release after cleanup;
- native pools amortize mapping and lock overhead across all slots; and
- `arena_report()` exposes capacity and lock-efficiency metadata without
  exposing secret contents.

Generations are diagnostic reuse identifiers. Rust lifetimes and the atomic
claim are the stale-handle defense.

## Page-Sealed Review Candidate

With the opt-in `page-seal` feature, `SealedSecretBytes<N>` keeps its data pages
inaccessible between scoped mutable-borrow access windows. Normal return and
panic unwinding both attempt to restore no-access protection. A detected
normal-return reseal failure clears and retires the mapping instead of
returning the closure result.

This remains a conditional 2.0 guarantee pending the CP-16 unsafe review and
native target evidence. Existing locked and guarded guarantees do not depend on
its acceptance.

Page-sealed cleanup is explicitly fallible. `SealedSecretBytes<N>` provides
`try_secure_sanitize()` but does not implement `SecureSanitize`, zeroize
interop traits, or stable-storage marker traits because an operating-system
failure may prevent an inaccessible page from becoming writable.

## Evidence

The repository carries release evidence in two forms:

- human-readable evidence in `docs/EVIDENCE.md`;
- machine-readable evidence in `docs/ct-evidence.json`, validated by
  `scripts/verify-evidence.py`.

The current evidence includes unit tests, release codegen checks, Miri where
available, and bounded Kani proof harnesses for selected wipe, comparison,
ordering, selection, and allocation-arithmetic properties. These are evidence
for specific claims, not blanket proof of all timing behavior on all targets.
