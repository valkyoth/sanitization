# Sanitization 2.0.0 Commit Implementation Plan

Status: planning document

This document converts the 2.0 architecture roadmap into bounded implementation
commits. It replaces alpha, beta, and release-candidate tags as development
checkpoints.

There are no intermediate 2.0 version tags or crates.io releases. Each
checkpoint ends at a reviewed commit, receives its own pentest or targeted
security review, and must be accepted before work starts on the next
checkpoint. Only the completed release receives the `v2.0.0` tag.

The architecture and security requirements remain normative in
[`ROADMAP_2.0.0.md`](ROADMAP_2.0.0.md). This document defines implementation
order, commit boundaries, verification, and review handoff.

## Commit Discipline

Each checkpoint uses a symbolic identifier such as `CP-04`. The identifier is
not a Git tag or version. Record the actual full commit hashes when the
checkpoint is implemented.

The normal flow is:

1. Start from the previous accepted checkpoint report commit.
2. Implement only the current checkpoint.
3. Run the checkpoint verification and the repository-wide required checks.
4. Create one implementation commit with the checkpoint identifier in the
   commit message.
5. Stop implementation.
6. Pentest the range from the previous accepted checkpoint through the new
   implementation commit.
7. Put temporary findings in root `PENTEST.md`.
8. Fix findings in one or more checkpoint-scoped remediation commits.
9. Delete `PENTEST.md` and rerun the entire checkpoint review range.
10. Commit a permanent PASS report as a report-only acceptance commit.
11. Start the next checkpoint only after the acceptance commit and CI are
    green.

If a checkpoint no longer fits in one coherent implementation commit, stop
before editing production code and split it in this plan. Do not stack multiple
planned implementation commits behind one later review merely to preserve the
original numbering.

The review range is:

```text
git diff <previous-accepted-report-commit>..<reviewed-through-commit>
```

If remediation commits are needed, `Reviewed-Through` names the last
remediation commit. The complete range is retested; the review does not inspect
only the final patch.

## Development Pentest Reports

Permanent development reports belong at:

```text
security/pentest/2.0-development/CP-XX.md
```

Every report must contain:

```text
Status: PASS
Checkpoint: CP-XX
Base-Commit: <40-character commit>
Reviewed-Through: <40-character commit>
Tester: <non-empty>
Review-Type: <targeted-internal|targeted-external|independent-audit|pentest|close-out>
Scope: <non-empty>
Date: YYYY-MM-DD
```

The report-only acceptance commit must:

- have `Reviewed-Through` as its first parent;
- change only the matching checkpoint report;
- contain no source, test, manifest, generated evidence, or documentation
  changes;
- be green in CI before the next checkpoint starts.

`CP-00` adds a validator for these rules. The final `v2.0.0` report continues
to use the normal release-report and signed-tag process.

The normal CI checks fetch complete Git history and validate every
report-changing commit from the fixed `CP-00` base through the tested branch
tip. Batched pushes therefore do not skip an earlier acceptance commit.

Checkpoint history must remain linear from the fixed `CP-00` base through the
current development tip. Merge commits are rejected; integrate parallel work
by rebasing or cherry-picking it into the checkpoint branch. Pull-request CI
checks the contributor branch head rather than GitHub's synthetic merge ref.

## Version And Tag Policy

- Do not create alpha, beta, RC, or checkpoint tags.
- Do not publish checkpoint packages.
- Do not bump workspace packages for every checkpoint.
- Keep checkpoint identity in commit messages and permanent development
  reports.
- Perform the coordinated workspace bump to `2.0.0` only in `CP-23`.
- Create and push `v2.0.0` only after the final report-only release commit.
- Continue using the 1.2.x line separately for eligible non-breaking
  backports.

## Required Checkpoint Baseline

Every implementation and remediation stop must run the applicable subset of:

- `scripts/checks.sh`;
- `scripts/verify-codegen.sh`;
- `scripts/verify-derive-failures.sh`;
- `scripts/verify-leakage-smoke.sh`;
- `scripts/verify-kani.sh`;
- `scripts/verify-miri.sh`;
- `scripts/verify-evidence.py`;
- workspace package-list checks;
- target-specific native checks required by the checkpoint.

The checkpoint may add stronger commands. A narrow checkpoint may skip an
unrelated expensive native job only when the permanent report records why it
was unrelated. The final evidence checkpoints run the complete matrix.

## Checkpoint Register

Update this table when a checkpoint starts. After its report-only acceptance
commit lands, mark it accepted in the next implementation commit. Exact
40-character base and reviewed-through hashes belong in the permanent report;
the report is the authoritative record.

Allowed status values are `Planned`, `Implementing`, `Pentest`, `Remediating`,
`Retest`, `Accepted`, and `Deferred`. `Deferred` is valid only for an optional
additive checkpoint and requires an accepted report containing the rationale
and the removed or reduced stable claim.

  acceptance commits;
- add tests for missing, malformed, stale, and multi-file reports;
- capture the 1.2.5 public API, feature matrix, package contents, unsafe-block
  inventory, codegen samples, and current target evidence;

- prohibit new major concepts;
- run semver and public-API comparison against 1.2.5 and the `CP-21` snapshot;
- run full independent audit/pentest across `CP-00..CP-22`;
- remediate every finding;
- rerun all native, codegen, Miri, Kani, Loom, sanitizer, timing, package, and
  downstream gates;
- classify any deferred additive feature explicitly.

Pentest focus:

- cross-workstream interactions;
- incomplete migration;
- inconsistent feature/profile behavior;
- stale evidence after remediation;
- unresolved security-model or production-readiness blockers.

Exit criteria:

- no open critical, high, or medium finding;
- no low finding contradicts a guarantee;
- API is frozen;
- the `CP-22` independent close-out PASS report is committed alone.

### `CP-23`: Final 2.0.0 Release Preparation

Recommended commit message:

```text
CP-23 prepare sanitization 2.0.0 release
```

Goal: perform only coordinated release metadata and final documentation work.

Deliverables:

- bump every publishing workspace crate to `2.0.0`;
- update internal dependency versions;
- update README examples and crates.io references;
- add complete 2.0.0 release notes;
- update changelog, release matrix, and release script order;
- validate package contents from generated crate archives;
- run the release script in check/dry-run mode;
- collect a final regression review of the metadata-only range after `CP-22`.

Pentest focus:

- wrong crate versions or dependency ranges;
- missing sister crates;
- package contents differing from reviewed workspace contents;
- stale documentation;
- release script publishing in the wrong order;
- accidental code changes after API freeze.

Exit criteria:

- the implementation commit contains no unreviewed functional change;
- all crates package correctly as `2.0.0`;
- full CI and release gates pass;
- the `CP-23` PASS report is committed alone.

## Final Release Commit And Tag

After `CP-23` is accepted:

1. Create `security/pentest/v2.0.0.md` reviewing the exact `CP-23` accepted
   implementation state.
2. Commit only that final report.
3. Run full CI, CodeQL, package, evidence, and release-readiness gates.
4. Confirm the release script publishes every changed crate in dependency
   order.
5. Create a signed `v2.0.0` tag at the final report-only commit.
6. Push only when explicitly requested.
7. Publish crates using the reviewed release script.

No functional remediation belongs in the final report commit. Any finding
reopens `CP-23`, requires a remediation commit, a clean retest, and a new final
report-only commit.

## Roadmap Coverage Matrix

| Roadmap area | Commit checkpoints |
|---|---|
| Workstream 0: module split | `CP-01` |
| Workstream 1: contracts and generic ownership | `CP-02`, `CP-03` |
| Workstream 2: exposure and copy reduction | `CP-04`, `CP-05` |
| Workstream 3: aggregates and representations | `CP-02`, `CP-05`, `CP-09`, `CP-17` |
| Workstream 4: data-oblivious API | `CP-06`, `CP-07`, `CP-20` |
| Workstream 5: derive behavior | `CP-08` |
| Workstream 6: ArrayVec | `CP-09` |
| Workstream 7: wipe backend | `CP-10`, `CP-17` |
| Workstream 8: cache and registers | `CP-11`, `CP-20` |
| Workstream 9: native protection | `CP-12`, `CP-13`, `CP-15`, `CP-16` |
| Workstream 10: one-access secrets | `CP-14` |
| Workstream 11: features and crates | `CP-18`, `CP-23` |
| Workstream 12: verification and evidence | `CP-00`, `CP-19`, `CP-20`, `CP-22` |
| Workstream 13: documentation | `CP-21`, `CP-23` |
| Security-model release blockers | `CP-01` through `CP-13`, as applicable |
| Production-readiness blockers | `CP-19` through `CP-23` |
| Optional additive decisions | `CP-05`, `CP-14` through `CP-17` |
| 1.2.x backport decisions | tracked separately before the affected 2.0 checkpoint |

## Completeness Rule

A roadmap item may leave this plan only through one of three outcomes:

1. implemented and accepted in its assigned checkpoint;
2. explicitly deferred with rationale, removed stable claims, and a named
   future issue or roadmap entry;
3. rejected because its security contract cannot be made credible.

Silently omitting an item is not an accepted outcome. Before `CP-22`, compare
the implementation against this matrix and the complete stable-scope lists in
`ROADMAP_2.0.0.md`.
