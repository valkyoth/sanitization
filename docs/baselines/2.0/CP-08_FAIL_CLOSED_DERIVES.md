# CP-08 Fail-Closed Derives

Status: implementation review record

Base commit: `6e7d496`

Checkpoint: `CP-08`

CP-08 makes aggregate sanitization derives reject ambiguous security behavior
by default.

## Enum Policy

`SecureSanitize` enum derives now require:

```rust
#[sanitization(enum_inactive_variant_bytes = "acknowledged")]
```

The diagnostic explains that only the active variant is safely reachable,
previously active larger variants may leave bytes behind, callers should use
`secure_replace` before transitions, and struct-based state machines are
preferred for high-assurance secret state.

The former `strict-enum-derive` feature is removed. There is no default mode
that silently accepts active-variant-only sanitization.

## Skip Policy

Every skipped field now requires a non-empty reason:

```rust
#[sanitization(skip, reason = "public algorithm identifier")]
```

The parser rejects:

- `skip` without `reason`;
- empty or whitespace-only reasons;
- `reason` without `skip`;
- duplicate `skip`, `reason`, `bound`, crate-path, or enum acknowledgement
  options;
- malformed and unsupported helper options;
- enum acknowledgements on structs.

`ConditionallySelectable` continues to reject skipped fields because every
output field must be constructed.

## Aggregate And Generic Coverage

The pass suite covers named, tuple, and unit structs, enum acknowledgement,
`PhantomData`, crate-path substitution, generic CT derives, and
`SecureSanitizeOnDrop` with a struct-level generic bound.

The downstream compile-failure suite covers CT enum rejection, skipped CT
selection fields, unacknowledged enums, missing and malformed skip reasons,
duplicate options, invalid enum acknowledgement, unions, and missing generic
drop bounds.
