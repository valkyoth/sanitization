//! Optional crypto crate interop helpers for `sanitization`.
//!
//! The core `sanitization` crate clears memory it owns. It cannot clear private
//! buffers inside third-party hash implementations unless those crates expose
//! their own zeroization hooks. This crate provides small feature-gated helpers
//! for those cases while keeping the core crate dependency-free.
