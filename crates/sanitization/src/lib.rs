//! Dependency-free secret memory sanitization for `no_std` Rust.
//!
//! The primary type is [`SecretBytes`], a fixed-size clear-on-drop container
//! designed for secrets that are controlled from creation through destruction.
//!
//! Clearing routes through a small internal volatile-write backend. That backend
//! uses one isolated unsafe boundary so the optimizer cannot remove secret
//! clearing as a dead store.
//!
//! The [`ct`] module provides dependency-free data-oblivious primitives such as
//! [`ct::Choice`], [`ct::ConstantTimeEq`], and explicit
//! [`ct::Choice::declassify`] boundaries. Secret-controlled indexes and
//! scalars use clear-on-drop [`ct::SecretIndex`] and [`ct::SecretScalar`]
//! owners, while [`ct::SecretCtOption`] and [`ct::SecretCtResult`] manage
//! secret-bearing dummy and unselected state. Its claim is no secret-dependent
//! control flow or memory access under documented conditions, not identical
//! wall-clock timing on every target.
//!
//! Important limits:
//! - Safe Rust cannot soundly scrub old stack frames created by prior moves.
//! - Process abort prevents destructors and post-closure cleanup from running.
//! - SIMD stores, broad memory policy, and target-specific hardening need
//!   target-specific unsafe code and platform policy.
//! - Platform memory locking is available only through the explicit
//!   `memory-lock` feature on supported Linux, Android, macOS, iOS, Windows,
//!   and BSD targets. On WASM, `memory-lock` must be paired with `wasm-compat`
//!   to expose volatile-only compatibility types without host memory locking.
//!   The same feature also enables pooled slots with [`SecretPool`] on
//!   supported targets.
//! - Locked, pooled, and guarded canary integrity checks are available only
//!   through the explicit `canary-check` feature on supported targets.
//! - OS-CSPRNG canary generation is available only through the explicit
//!   `random-canary` feature.
//! - x86_64/AArch64 assembly-backed comparison is available only through the explicit
//!   `asm-compare` feature.
//! - Fail-closed assembly-backed equal-length byte comparison is available
//!   through `strict-compare`. This feature does not strengthen ordering,
//!   selection, lookup, or caller code. Other fail-closed profiles include
//!   `strict-canary-check` and `require-fork-exclusion`.
//! - Named native profiles bundle reviewed capabilities without claiming that
//!   runtime protections succeeded. Use [`ProtectionRequest`] to inspect the
//!   policy and [`ProtectionReport`] to inspect achieved controls.
//! - Checked x86_64 cache-line eviction is available through the explicit
//!   `cache-flush` feature. Other architectures and Miri return a structured
//!   unsupported result after sanitizing helpers have still cleared memory.
//! - Proc-macro derives are available only through the explicit `derive`
//!   feature. The default build remains dependency-free.
//! - `zeroize`, `subtle`, and `serde` integration are available only through
//!   explicit `zeroize-interop`, `subtle-interop`, and `serde` features. They
//!   are off by default.
//! - UTF-8 validation, serde size-limit rejection, and public-length mismatch
//!   handling are not data-oblivious operations. Callers must treat validity
//!   and length as public metadata when using text or variable-length APIs.
//! - Fixed-size lifetime enforcement is available only through the `std`
//!   feature and [`ExpiringSecretBytes`].
//! - Guard-page allocation is available only through the explicit
//!   `guard-pages` feature on supported Linux, Android, macOS, iOS, Windows,
//!   and BSD targets.
//! - WASM has no kernel page table, `mlock`, `mprotect`, or native volatile
//!   semantics. Base secret containers compile on WASM. `memory-lock` exposes
//!   volatile-only compatibility types on WASM only when `wasm-compat` is also
//!   enabled, so callers explicitly acknowledge the reduced guarantees.
//!   `guard-pages` is rejected at compile time on WASM.
//!
//! # Migrating From 1.x
//!
//! Version 2 makes storage stability, CT declassification, derive safety,
//! mapped integrity, and runtime protection outcomes explicit. The complete
//! source-change inventory and replacement examples are maintained in
//! [`docs/MIGRATION_2.0.md`](https://github.com/valkyoth/sanitization/blob/main/docs/MIGRATION_2.0.md).
//! Generic `Secret<T>` exposure is governed by the conditional contracts in
//! [`docs/STORAGE_CONTRACTS.md`](https://github.com/valkyoth/sanitization/blob/main/docs/STORAGE_CONTRACTS.md),
//! and native hardening policy/report semantics are defined in
//! [`docs/PROTECTION_REPORT.md`](https://github.com/valkyoth/sanitization/blob/main/docs/PROTECTION_REPORT.md).
