# Loom Concurrency Models

This unpublished tool models:

- the atomic claim and cleanup ordering used by
  `sanitization::ConsumeOnceSecret<T>`; and
- fixed-slot `SecretPool` allocation, clear-before-release, generation reuse,
  and failed-setup rollback.

Run it with:

```text
cargo test --release --manifest-path tools/consume-once-loom/Cargo.toml
```

The models verify that racing consumers cannot both enter a consume-once value,
racing allocators cannot overlap one pool slot, reuse observes a cleared slot
with a new generation, and failed setup releases its claim exactly once. Panic,
application-error, native mapping, and canary behavior are tested against the
production types in the main crate's test suite.
