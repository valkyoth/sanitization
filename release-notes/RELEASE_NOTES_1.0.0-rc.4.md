# Release 1.0.0-rc.4

- Hardened equal-length comparison accumulators against optimizer-introduced
  short-circuiting.
- Added `SecretBytes::expose_secret_volatile` behind `unsafe-wipe` for volatile
  clearing of temporary stack copies on normal and unwind paths.
- Switched `SecretVec` and `SecretString` growth to exponential capacity
  growth to avoid repeated exact reallocations.
- Updated safety, threat model, and README documentation for volatile string
  wiping, best-effort clearing limits, and abort behavior.
