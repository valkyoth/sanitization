# Release 2.0.0

Version 2.0.0 is a security-model release. It preserves the dependency-free,
`no_std` default and canonical volatile wipe backend while making generic
storage, exposure, data-oblivious control state, derive behavior, and native
protection outcomes more explicit and fail-closed.

Page-sealed cleanup now attempts mapping release while an unwiped payload is
still locked. If both page normalization and release fail, the poisoned mapping
remains locked for a later cleanup retry, and its protection report continues
to reflect the live lock. Successful release retires the mapping and clears its
current protection-state accounting.

The dependency-free default now enables `asm-compare`. Reviewed x86_64 and
AArch64 targets therefore use the assembly-backed equal-length equality path
without requiring an opt-in feature. Repeated independent AArch64 Linux
leakage runs rejected the portable fallback as release timing evidence;
`default-features = false` still exposes that fallback, but 2.0 makes no
AArch64 timing claim for it. `sanitization-crypto-interop` forwards the same
dependency-free default for its HMAC and BLAKE3 verification helpers.

`wipe::maybe_uninit` now clears non-live `MaybeUninit<T>` storage without
constructing references to uninitialized byte values. The
`sanitization-arrayvec` companion uses this typed path for complete inline
spare-capacity cleanup.

The `sanitization-bytes` companion now requires patched `bytes 1.11.1` or
newer, preventing fresh downstream lockfiles from resolving versions affected
by `RUSTSEC-2026-0007`.

`SecureSanitizeOnDrop` and `secure_drop_struct!` now require
`DropSafeSanitize + Unpin` owners and invoke the complete sanitizer. Generated
field-wise sanitizers receive the drop-safe marker automatically, while manual
aggregate sanitizers must explicitly attest that destructor-path cleanup is
complete and non-recursive.

The runtime now exact-pins `sanitization-derive` to the matching release, and
release gates enforce that lockstep so generated runtime trait references
cannot be paired with an older core crate.

Wrapping an existing `bytes::BytesMut` now immediately volatile-clears its
spare capacity so historical bytes from pre-wrap truncation do not survive.

CI now enforces a source, license, wildcard, and duplicate-version policy with
`cargo-deny 0.20.2` across every Cargo graph. The rustup fallback installer is
versioned and SHA-256 pinned instead of executing a downloaded shell script.

The release also refreshes the derive stack to `syn 3.0.0`,
`proc-macro2 1.0.107`, and `quote 1.0.47`, updates serde to `1.0.229`, and pins
release-evidence uploads to `actions/upload-artifact v7.0.1`.

Linux-specific CSPRNG and page-lifecycle fault-injection helpers are now
compiled only with the Linux tests that exercise them. Supported non-Linux
all-target test builds therefore remain warning-free without suppressing
production lints.

The multi-seed leakage collector now normalizes Unicode formatting whitespace
around command-line arguments, avoiding false "required argument" errors when
commands are copied from rendered documentation or chat clients.

## Ownership And Exposure

- Renamed checked mapped-container operations to `try_*`, removed redundant
  `*_checked` aliases, and kept `*_or_panic` only for deliberate fail-stop
  application policy. Fallible generator callbacks use explicit
  `try_replace_from_fallible_*` names.
- Added `StableSharedSecretStorage` and `StableMutableSecretStorage` contracts.
  Generic `Secret<T>` exposure now requires an explicit storage-stability
  attestation covering safe shared access, interior mutation, mutable access,
  callbacks, guards, trait methods, and destruction.
- Fixed-size containers now expose their owned storage directly. Core APIs that
  create temporary copies are reason-bearing `export_*` boundaries so the
  extra secret lifetime is visible and searchable.
- Added `SecretBoxBytes` for fixed-allocation runtime-length secret bytes that
  never grow, reallocate, or expose their private backing allocation.
- Made dynamic `SecretVec` and `SecretString` generation genuinely fallible for
  capacity arithmetic and allocation. Added bounded generator constructors
  that reject application-defined public maxima before allocation or callback
  execution.
- Added shared `SecretAllocationError` and `SecretGenerateError<E>`
  classifications plus bounded slice and UTF-8 string copy constructors.
  Bounded character generation now checks worst-case UTF-8 bytes with checked
  arithmetic against an explicit byte ceiling.
- Renamed `ReadOnceSecret<T>` to `ConsumeOnceSecret<T>`. Its single scoped
  shared access is claimed atomically and cleared on normal return, returned
  errors, and panic unwinding.

## Data-Oblivious State

- Unified equal-length equality dispatch so `ct::eq_fixed`, native
  secret-container CT traits, and crypto-interop HMAC/BLAKE3 verification use
  the strict assembly backend when enabled. Path-specific LLVM IR checks now
  prove those representative call paths reach that backend.
- Made `Choice`, masks, and `CtOrdering` declassification reason-bearing and
  removed ordinary equality or raw extraction paths that bypassed the review
  boundary.
- Replaced the generic copyable CT marker with redacted, non-`Copy`,
  clear-on-drop `SecretIndex` and `SecretScalar<T>` owners.
- Added `PublicValue<T>`, `SecretValue<T>`, `SecretCtOption`, and
  `SecretCtResult` so dummy, unselected, mapped, and panic-path secret values
  receive explicit cleanup.
- Renamed `strict-ct` to `strict-compare` to state its actual scope:
  assembly-backed equal-length byte equality on reviewed native targets.
- Expanded Kani, codegen, leakage, panic-unwind, ownership-transition, and
  zero-sized/drop-bearing test coverage for the native CT API.

## Derives And Companion Crates

- Rejected enum `SecureSanitize` and `SecureSanitizeOnDrop` derives because
  generated safe code cannot clear inactive variant storage and final-drop
  cleanup cannot repair prior transitions. Reviewed manual enums must use
  `secure_replace` before every transition; stable-layout structs are preferred.
- Required every skipped derive field to include a non-empty reason and
  rejected duplicate, malformed, empty, or misplaced helper attributes.
- Kept constant-time derives struct-only and field-wise; enums, unions, and
  unsafe selection skips remain compile failures.
- Corrected `sanitization-arrayvec` so live values are sanitized and dropped
  before the complete inline backing region, including historical spare bytes,
  is volatile-cleared.
- Added secure ArrayVec `pop` and `truncate` handling with valid destructor
  ordering and stale-slot cleanup.

## Wiping And Native Hardening

- Pool-slot Drop now verifies canaries before clearing can rewrite them, making
  corruption quarantine unconditional even when no checked accessor follows
  the corruption. Random expected canaries are non-`Copy`, borrowed in place,
  and clear on ordinary, pooled, and page-sealed teardown.
- Consolidated clearing behind the canonical safe `sanitization::wipe` API and
  private sealed `wipe_backend`; removed misleading best-effort and
  `unsafe-wipe` compatibility surfaces.
- Added `wipe::WipeOnDrop<T>` for the audited built-in plain-data set. Public
  downstream representation-erasure implementations remain intentionally
  unsupported.
- Added `ProtectionRequest`, required/preferred policy, structured
  `ProtectionReport` outcomes, and partial setup reports so compiled features
  are not confused with achieved runtime protection.
- Made fork inheritance, dump exclusion, memory locking, guard pages, and
  canary integrity explicit per-container policy outcomes.
- Hardened `SecretPool` with checked fixed-layout accounting, generation-bound
  canaries, failure quarantine, and efficiency reporting.
- Preserved CSPRNG, mapping, canary-integrity, length, and caller-generator
  failures through operation-specific `LockedSecretInitError`, `PoolInitError`,
  and `SecretPoolGenerateError<E>` types. Pool initialization reserves
  `Ok(None)` exclusively for exhaustion and removes lossy allocation helpers.
- Added checked direct initialization of final locked fixed-size storage.
  `try_init_with` supports custom protection requests, while `from_fill` and
  `try_from_fill` use the same configured pre/post integrity checks and clear
  partial output on callback failure. `LockedSecretBytesFillError<E>` and
  `LockedSecretInitializeError<E>` preserve those error classes. Filled
  replacements are verified before swap.
- Made pool integrity failure clear and permanently quarantine the affected
  slot. Added aggregate quarantine telemetry without exposing addresses,
  canary values, or secret bytes.
- Added pre/post integrity verification around normal mapped exposure and
  persistent poison state for standalone locked and guarded owners. Clearing
  physical canary words no longer makes a corrupted owner reusable.
- Added opt-in `SealedSecretBytes<N>` with guard pages, fallible page sealing,
  poisoning/retirement after unsafe transition failures, and multi-page fault
  recovery tests. This remains a reviewed optional facility with documented
  platform limits, not an infallible secrecy guarantee.
- Added `SealedSecretBytes::try_close()` with structured page-normalization,
  unlock, and unmap outcomes. Failed mapping release remains poisoned and
  retryable, and retains its memory lock when erasure was not confirmed;
  `Drop` uses the same path as a final best-effort fallback.
- Reworked cache eviction and SIMD/vector scrubbing to report supported,
  executed, limited, and unsupported outcomes instead of implying universal
  hardware coverage.
- Added named hardened-native, guarded-native, and Linux hardening profiles;
  runtime requests and reports remain authoritative over feature selection.
- Added profile-matched type constructors such as
  `LockedSecretBytes::zeroed_hardened_native()` and
  `GuardedSecretVec::with_capacity_guarded_native()`. Custom deployments retain
  the explicit `*_with_protection` policy path.
- Added `ProtectionReport::satisfies`, `is_degraded`, common-control status
  helpers, and a zero-allocation unavailable-control iterator while preserving
  every detailed report field.
- Added a dependency-free downstream storage-policy lint and compile-checked
  private-policy example. Sensitive roots can reject direct `Secret<T>`,
  marker impls outside approved files, public policy types, and destructor
  bypass through `mem::forget`, `Box::leak`, or `ManuallyDrop` in CI.

## Verification And Release Evidence

- Added path-specific LLVM IR and assembly checks across optimization, LTO,
  panic, and codegen-unit profiles.
- Added lifecycle allocation-quarantine probes, Loom concurrency models,
  sanitizer jobs, fail-closed negative fixtures, Miri/Kani coverage, and
  downstream migration builds.
- Added repeated multi-seed dudect-style leakage runs and relative performance
  baselines for x86_64 Linux, AArch64 Linux, and Apple Silicon.
- Recorded native and compile-only target tiers, exact accepted workflow URLs,
  and GitHub artifact SHA-256 digests in the 2.0 release evidence record.
- Added semantic public-API snapshots and semver review for all five
  publishable crates, freezing the CP-21 API before final release metadata.
- Added complete migration, storage-contract, protection-report, scope,
  guarantees, non-guarantees, target, evidence, and verification-tooling docs.
- Updated package archive validation and publication tooling for all five
  `2.0.0` crates in dependency order.
- Updated dependency-audit detection to use Cargo's subcommand registry and
  scan every committed workspace, fuzz, and tooling lockfile.
- Added a CI declassification-reason lint with fail-closed fixtures. Consumer
  call sites must use meaningful direct literals rather than dynamic or
  placeholder labels; human review remains authoritative.
- Added a fail-closed initialization lint that rejects discarded `try_*`
  results through explicit `drop`, `.ok()`, or unhandled underscore bindings,
  plus lossy pool allocation in production source. Negative fixtures cover
  each suppression form while checked propagation and fail-stop handling remain
  accepted.
- Added a deployment-hardening responsibility matrix covering abort behavior,
  private policy gates, native protection reports, privileged attackers, WASM,
  canary response, swap/hibernation, and explicit cleanup.
- Added reason-bearing high-level CT helpers for final fixed equality, fixed
  ordering, and public-length equality decisions while retaining low-level
  `Choice` and `CtOrdering` composition APIs.
- Replaced the monolithic README with a three-level user journey, a concise
  type-selection table, small recipes, and separate feature/advanced guides.
- Sealed `wipe::Wipe` to its audited built-in implementations and added a
  downstream compile-fail guard against no-op `WipeOnDrop<T>` implementations.
- Added concise checked-error composition through `IntegrityResult`,
  `MappedResult`, the descriptive `SecretIntegrityResult` alias,
  `SecretIntegrityResultExt`, common `?` conversions, operation-error mapping
  helpers, and one-shot requested-protection report validation.
- Documented recommended library propagation, mapped text, fail-stop, and
  application error-boundary patterns without collapsing distinct failures
  into one global error enum.
- Added `AllowlistedSecret<T, P>` and a rationale-bearing policy macro so
  closed deployments can centrally approve exact storage types while retaining
  the independent shared/mutable stability bounds.
- Rejected empty and ASCII-whitespace-only storage-policy rationales at compile
  time so policy approvals cannot carry blank review metadata.
- Kept storage contracts deliberately non-derived: field inspection cannot
  prove method behavior, interior mutation, guard cleanup, callbacks, or
  deferred allocation release.
